## College Recruitment Improvement Study - Python Analysis
---
This project is a continuation of the first project (CMP-Project1) which performs an analysis of the data from the Fall 2022 CCM Computing Literacy Course Entry Survey.  This repository includes a source csv file that was derived from the original survey data and a Jupyter notebook which reads in this file and includes analysis on it.
